# Android practice notepad
The purpose of this project is to practice my android development skills. This app is just going to be an extremely bare bones note taking app. I'm going to update it with features as I learn how to implement the features I want.

There are going to be A LOT of mistakes in the beginning but hey, every developer has to start somewhere.
